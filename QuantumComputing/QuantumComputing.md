## 🧠 Introduction to Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is an emerging field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use **qubits**, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to **superposition** and **entanglement**. This allows quantum computers to process massive amounts of data in parallel, potentially solving problems that are currently impossible for classical systems.

### 🌍 Why Quantum Computing Matters
Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize industries by enabling faster and more efficient solutions to complex problems:
- **Cryptography:** Breaking or enhancing encryption systems with quantum algorithms like Shor’s algorithm.
- **Optimization:** Enhancing logistics, finance, and energy systems.
- **Drug Discovery:** Simulating molecular structures for faster medical breakthroughs.
- **Machine Learning:** Accelerating data analysis through quantum-enhanced models.
- **Material Science:** Designing materials with specific quantum properties.

### ⚛️ Key Concepts to Understand Before Starting
- **Qubit:** The quantum version of a bit.
- **Superposition:** A qubit’s ability to be in multiple states at once.
- **Entanglement:** A quantum link between qubits where one’s state depends on another.
- **Quantum Gates:** Operations that manipulate qubits.
- **Quantum Algorithms:** Instructions executed on quantum hardware (e.g., Grover’s and Shor’s algorithms).
