## üü¢ Beginner Level

### üß† What is Web3 developer?
A Web3 Developer works on the user-facing side of blockchain ‚Äî combining web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) with blockchain integration. Some common tasks of a web developer are Connecting web apps to smart contracts, Using libraries like web3.js or ethers.js, Building dApp frontends that interact with blockchains, Handling crypto wallets (like MetaMask integration).

### Who is a Blockchain developer?
A Blockchain Developer builds and maintains applications that run on blockchain networks (like Ethereum, Solana, or Bitcoin). They deal with smart contracts, cryptography, and distributed ledgers. some common tasks of a blockchain developer are Writing smart contracts (usually in Solidity, Rust, or Vyper), Building decentralized applications (dApps), Managing blockchain nodes and transactions, Integrating wallets and tokens.
