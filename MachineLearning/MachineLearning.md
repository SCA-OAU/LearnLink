## üü¢ Beginners Level

### üß† What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves creating algorithms that can analyze data, learn patterns, and make decisions.

**Why it‚Äôs important:** Machine learning powers many of today‚Äôs most exciting technologies, from voice assistants to recommendation systems.
